I've had my fair share of adventures in my life - well, not an outstanding amount - but enough to say that I think I've lived my life appropriately in the time I have been alive.

2016 has been the year that I get more in touch with what I'm studying - an area that I haven't really had much time to explore considering the other projects I have been a part of thus far, and an area that it has brought me to are hackathons, and the Melbourne Tech Community.

UNIHACK is something that I've taken on board this year, it's brought me to meet great people, I've found areas where I think I may want to go after my university years, and that's a great thing despite feeling absolutely lost in life.

UNIHACK has become a project I'm holding quite close, and I hope to see it grow even more in the future.

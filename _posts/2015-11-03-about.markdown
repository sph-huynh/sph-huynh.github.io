So there are things that I enjoy - like photography - all photos on this website are taken by me. So I say that I like arts, and I really do mean it. It's not something I get a lot of time to do, but the arts are something I do very much enjoy and mean a lot to me.
                  
I've been getting into videography these days, though something it has made me realise is that despite my great love for music, I am yet to get to the stage where I have the patience and time to make my own music - for my enjoyment, or for these videos.

This is one that I've made below, it means absolutely nothing, but I enjoyed the process of making it very much
